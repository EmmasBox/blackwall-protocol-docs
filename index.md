# Blackwall Protocol

Blackwall Protocol is a terminal-based administration panel for [RACF](https://www.ibm.com/products/resource-access-control-facility). As Blackwall is written in Python, it is simple to install via the pip package manager. It is designed to be used via an SSH connection to z/OS UNIX. Blackwall incorporates dynamic and true color, tool tips, dynamic UI, dynamically re-sizable windows, and tabs to give a better user experience. The tab-driven design allows security administrators and engineers to have multiple items open simultaneously. Blackwall also allows you to submit TSO and RACF commands from an always-visible command line. Input can then be viewed either through a tab or a separate screen. The Blackwall command line also comes with rudimentary command autocompletion, to further speed up power users. Blackwall is designed to be used by everyone, both power users and seasoned security specialists.
