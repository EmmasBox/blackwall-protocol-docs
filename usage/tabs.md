# Tabs

Blackwall is tab driven, just like your web browser. Blackwall's tab driven design means you can easily bounce between tasks by opening tabs for things like user management or compare different things on the system.

## Opening tabs

You can open a new tab by pressing a variety of key presses, to open a user management tab you'd press **ctrl+u**, however make sure that the tab section is actually selected and not the command line or another element. You can see some of the keybindings at the bottom of the screen or you can see [keybindings documentation](./keybindings.md) for how you can bring up a full list of the keybindings for opening tabs.

## Closing tabs

You can close the currently active tab by pressing **ctrl+w** on the keyboard, you can clear all of the active tabs by pressing **ctrl+shift+w** on the keyboard, please don't do this if you have any unsaved work in your tabs.

## Navigating tabs

You can navigate through open tabs with the arrow keys if you have the tab section selected, or you can simply use the mouse to click on them.
